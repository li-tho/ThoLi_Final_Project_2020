God can use a life without limbs
to show the world how to
live a life without limits!

“For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord,
plans to prosper you and not to harm you,
plans to give you hope and a future.”
Jeremiah 29:11 

Nicholas James "Nick" Vujicic; born 4 December 1982 is an Australian Christian evangelist and motivational speaker born with Phocomelia, 
a rare disorder characterised by the absence of legs and arms. As a child, he struggled mentally and emotionally as well as physically, 
but eventually came to terms with his disability. He presents motivational speeches worldwide which focus on living with disabilities and 
finding hope and meaning in life. Despite issues with bullying and depression during his childhood, Vujicic thrived in his teenage and 
young adult years. During secondary school, he was elected vice captain of Runcorn State High School in Queensland and worked with the student 
council on fundraising events for local charities and disability campaigns. 

After his mother showed him a newspaper article about a man dealing with a severe disability when he was seventeen, 
he started to give talks at his prayer group and later founded his non-profit organisation, Life Without Limbs. 
He has also founded a motivational speaking company, Attitude Is Altitude. From then on, there was no looking back for this young man, 
who now has founded his own organization, called ‘Life Without Limbs’. 
He has released motivational films, like 'Life's Greater Purpose' and 'Biography of a Determined Man of Faith'. 
He has also written a book titled 'Life Without Limits: Inspiration for a Ridiculously Good Life'. 
This speaker has even acted in a short film, ‘The Butterfly Circus’, earning the film three awards, 
and bagging one himself, for his brilliant portrayal of a man very much like himself, who is given a second chance to love himself. 

He is a devout Christian, believing that God loves everyone equally, and has taken it upon himself to spread the message to everyone around the world 
Nick Vujicic, famous for his inspirational speeches, was born without limbs in his body. However, instead of letting his disability deter his everyday life, 
he took it as a challenge, using it to change millions of lives with the same faith that kept him going. As a child of ten, 
he always wondered why he was different from others, and decided to drown himself since he saw no purpose to his living. 

However, he stopped himself in time, thinking of his loving parents and how much it would hurt them to see him dead.

BIO 

“If God can use a man without arms and legs to be His hands and feet, then He will certainly use any willing heart!”  
Nick Vujicic
Imagine getting through your busy day without hands or legs. Picture your life without the ability to walk, 
care for your basic needs, or even embrace those you love. 
Meet Nicholas Vujicic (pronounced VOO-yee-cheech). Without any medical explanation or warning, 
Nick was born in 1982 in Melbourne, Australia, without arms and legs. 
Three sonograms failed to reveal complications. And yet, the Vujicic family was destined to cope 
with both the challenge and blessing of raising 
a son who refused to allow his physical condition to limit his lifestyle.

The early days were difficult. Throughout his childhood, Nick not only dealt with 
the typical challenges of school and adolescence, but he also struggled with depression and loneliness. 
Nick constantly wondered why he was different than all the other kids. 
He questioned the purpose of life, or if he even had a purpose.

According to Nick, the victory over his struggles, as well as his strength and passion for life today, 
can be credited to his faith in God.
His family, friends and the many people he has encountered along the journey have inspired him to carry on, as well.

Since his first speaking engagement at age 19, Nick has traveled around the world, sharing his story with millions, 
sometimes in stadiums filled to capacity, speaking to a range of diverse groups such as students, teachers, 
young people, business professionals and church congregations of all sizes. 
Today this dynamic young evangelist has accomplished more than most people achieve in a lifetime. 
He’s an author, musician, actor, and his hobbies include fishing, painting and swimming. 
In 2007, Nick made the long journey from Australia to southern California. 
Nick established Life Without Limbs ministry in 2005. 
He is currently serving as President and CEO.

Life Without Limbs (LWL) is an international non-profit ministry whose purpose is to saturate 
the world with the Gospel and unite the body of Christ through the life and testimony of Nick Vujicic. 
Since 2005, over One Million people have made a decision for Christ at Life Without Limbs events. 
Praise God! LWL’s goal is that One Billion will hear the Gospel by 2028. 
LWL shares the Gospel through live events, prison ministry, 
digital ministry and prayer & encouragement ministry.

“If just one more person finds eternal life in Jesus Christ… it is all worth it! 
You can help me reach the world for Jesus by partnering with Life Without Limbs.”     -Nick

Nick Vujici Quotes 
- It’s a lie to think you’re not good enough. It’s a lie to think you’re not worth anything.

- Don’t put your life on hold so that you can dwell on the unfairness of past hurts.
 
- Having faith, beliefs, and convictions is a great thing, but your life is measured by the actions you take based upon them.

- But there is one thing better than going to Heaven and that is to encourage at least one other person to go with me.

- Fear is the biggest disability of all. And will paralyze you more than being in a wheelchair.

- As long as you are aware and in control of your emotions, negative thoughts can produce positive consequences.

- Character cannot be developed in ease and quiet. Only through experience of trial and 
	suffering can the soul be strengthened, ambition inspired, and success achieved.

ABOUT LOVE WITHOUT LIMITS
It Doesn’t Take a Perfect Person to Find a Perfect Love
 
Even though he was born without arms or legs, Nick Vujicic created a “ridiculously good life.” But after dating disappointments 
and a failed relationship, he reached his mid-twenties worried that he would never find a woman to love him and share his life. 
Then Nick met Kanae and everything changed.  But even with undeniable chemistry, they would have to navigate twists and 
turns worthy of a romantic comedy before becoming “one” in marriage. 
In Love Without Limits Nick and Kanae tell how they improbably found each other, fell in love, and 
then fought to overcome skepticism from others about their relationship. Filled with practical insights that will benefit any couple, 
this inspiring book describes a godly courtship and the early years of the Vujicics’ marriage and parenting journey.
Above all, Love Without Limits is an inspiring reminder that when Christ is at the center of a relationship–even with serious challenges–true love will triumph.
 
“Despite my optimism about other parts of life, I decided that love in this world had limits after all. 
I’d become convinced that no woman would want to marry such an obviously imperfect man as me….”
As a boy growing up in Australia, Nick Vujicic could not understand why God had allowed him to be born without limbs 
and if He would ever bring a woman into Nick’s life. On the other side of the world, Kanae Miyahara—a girl growing up in 
Mexico—saw dysfunction sadly separate her family.  She wondered if a loving, lasting marriage was even possible.  
Later, when Nick realized that God had a purpose for him, his life took on new meaning.  But after a long-term relationship ended in heartache, 
would he ever find someone to marry? Kanae experienced relationships based on superficial attraction, 
but she longed to find a mate with strong character and faith—a man who would be a godly husband and father.  
When Nick and Kanae met in the most amazing way, they realized that God—the ultimate Matchmaker– had used even their discouraging and 
painful experiences to prepare them for each other…for the love of their life.
