            <blockquote class="col-1-1">
                It’s a lie to think you’re not good enough.<br>
                It’s a lie to think you’re not worth anything.<br></blockquote>

            <blockquote class="col-1-1">
                Don’t put your life on hold so that<br>
                you can dwell on the unfairness of past hurts.<br></blockquote>

            <blockquote class="col-1-1">
                Having faith, beliefs, and convictions is a great thing,<br>
                but your life is measured by the actions you take based upon them.<br></blockquote>

            <blockquote class="col-1-1">
                But there is one thing better than going to Heaven and<br>
                that is to encourage at least one other person to go with me.<br></blockquote>

            <blockquote class="col-1-1">
                Fear is the biggest disability of all. And will paralyze<br>
                you more than being in a wheelchair.<br></blockquote>

            <blockquote class="col-1-1">
                As long as you are aware and in control of your emotions,<br>
                negative thoughts can produce positive consequences.<br></blockquote>

            <blockquote class="col-1-1">
                Character cannot be developed in ease and quiet. Only through experience of trial and<br>
                suffering can the soul be strengthened, ambition inspired, and success achieved.<br></blockquote>
