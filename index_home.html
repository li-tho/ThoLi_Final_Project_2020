        <p><strong>Nicholas James Vujicic</strong> born on December 4, 1982, is an Australian evangelist and
            famous motivational<br>
            speaker born with tetra-amelia syndrome, a rare disorder characterized by the absence of arms
            and legs.</p>

        <p>He was born with <em>no arms</em> and <em>no legs</em>, Nick Vujicic has overcome life’s <br>
            challenges through strength & hope found in God Almighty.</p>

        <p>Nick Vujicic was born without arms and legs. On the morning of his birth, his father was so
            stunned,<br>
            he almost fainted. Nicks mother refused to look at him or hold him for 4 long months. <br>
            Doctors said Nick would be a vegetable.</p>

        <p>Rather, he learned to write, operate an electric <em>wheelchair</em> and use a <em>computer with
                his toes</em>.<br>
            Rather than sending Nick to a specialized school for <em>children with disabilities</em>, <br>
            his parents sent him to a public school.</p>

        <img src="nv_photo1.jpg" alt="Nick Vujicic">

        <p>His schoolfellows bullied him and teased him constantly because of the way he looked.<br>
            Growing up, Nick struggled with depression and felt completely hopeless.</p>

        <p>When Nick was 10 years old he tried to drown himself in his family’s bathtub. After several
            attempts, <br>
            he realized that he didn’t want his loved ones to suffer. Nick eventually came to terms with his
            disability <br>
            and worked on adopting a positive attitude.</p>

        <p>As he has said “<em>The challenges in our lives are there to strengthen our convictions. <br>
                They are not there to run us over</em>.”</p>

        <p>At the age of 17, he had an inspiring encounter with his high school janitor that changed his
            life forever.<br>
            The janitor told Nick that “<em>You’re going to be a speaker</em>”. The janitor saw something in
            Nick<br>
            that he didn’t see himself and encouraged him to share his story.</p>

        <p>Nick gave his first speech in front of an audience of six students. <br>
            After realizing that he wasn’t alone in his struggles, Nick wanted to help <br>
            others find hope and meaning in life.</p>

        <p>Nick decided to go into Public Speaking to inspire others. <br>
            Nick founded his non-profit organization ‘<strong>Life Without Limbs</strong>’. <br>
            It gave him a platform to share his testimony and campaign against bullying.</p>

        <p>Since then, Nick has traveled to over sixty countries and inspired millions of people around the
            world. <br>
            Nick has given over 3000 speeches, speaking to people from all walks of life.</p>

        <p>Today, Nick is one of the most in-demand motivational speakers in the world. <br>
            Nick has learned not to let his limitations stop him from enjoying a happy life.</p>

        <p>Nick has been skydiving, surfs, swims and paint in his spare time.</p>

        <p>In 2008, Nick met a woman that came to hear him give a Motivational Speech.<br>
            They fell madly in love and got married four years later. <br>
            Today Nick Vujicic is the father of 4 children.</p>

        <p>Nick Vujicic’s first book is a bestselling book and has been translated too over 30 languages.
        </p>

        <p>Nick Vujicic’s success story teaches us that anything is possible with a positive attitude.
            Never lose hope and believe in yourself. Keep moving forward without looking back.</p>
